# multicat
A basic implementation of MultiCat, a visualisation technique for multidimensional categorical data.
This project is derived from a template created by Connor Rothschild for his /newline course, "[Better Data Visualizations with Svelte](https://www.newline.co/courses/better-data-visualizations-with-svelte/welcome)."
It uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/). The D3 modules most commonly used in data visualization are already installed.
